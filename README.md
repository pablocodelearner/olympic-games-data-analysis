Gold, silver and bronze. The Olympic Games through Data.

Project Overview

Welcome to the Olympic Medal Analysis project! This data science project aims to explore the distribution of Olympic medals across various countries and analyze the relationship between a country's economic strength, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and its Olympic performance. This analysis is particularly timely, coinciding with the Paris Olympic Games of 2024, providing a fresh perspective on the factors influencing athletic success on the global stage.

Dataset Information
This project utilizes the following datasets:

Olympic Medals Data: Sourced from Wikipedia's All-time Olympic Games medal table.
GDP Data: Sourced from the World Bank, including GDP values for the years 2022 and 2023.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/olympic-medal-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd olympic-medal-analysis
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can set up a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure all required datasets are placed in the data/ directory or properly linked if fetched online.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook olympic_analysis.ipynb
or:

bash
Copy code
python olympic_analysis.py
The analysis will generate various visualizations and statistical outputs, which can be viewed directly in the notebook or saved as files.

Analysis & Visualizations
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The data is cleaned to remove irrelevant entries and normalized for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial insights are gained through histograms and descriptive statistics.
Correlation Analysis: The relationship between GDP and Olympic medals is examined using Pearson correlation and visualized through scatter plots with regression lines.
Outlier Analysis: Countries with extreme data points, like the USA and China, are analyzed separately to understand their impact on global trends.
Key Findings
A strong positive correlation between a country’s GDP and the total number of Olympic medals won.
The removal of outliers slightly affects the correlation, highlighting the significant influence of major economies on global athletic performance.
Visualizations reveal disparities in Olympic success, with wealthier nations generally outperforming others.
